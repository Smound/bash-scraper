This is a scraper we (Ecce, Linda, Giacomo) built in shell. It scrapes
down all recipes from [recept.se](https://recept.se) to disk, and
allows to easily search for recipes.

# How to use it

First, run `webscraper`, once that is done, run
`webscraper_stage_2`. Once both are done, you can use `search.sh` to
search for a recipe. `search` accepts regexps.
